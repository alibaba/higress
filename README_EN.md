Higress is a cloud-native api gateway based on Alibaba's internal gateway practices. 

Powered by [Istio](https://github.com/istio/istio) and [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy), Higress realizes the integration of the triple gateway architecture of traffic gateway, microservice gateway and security gateway, thereby greatly reducing the costs of deployment, operation and maintenance.
