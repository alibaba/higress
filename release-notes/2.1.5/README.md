## üåü Detailed Description of Key Features

Here is a detailed description of the important features and improvements in this release:

### 1. feat: add DB MCP Server execute, list tables, describe table tools

**Related PR**: [#2506](https://github.com/alibaba/higress/pull/2506) | **Contributor**: [hongzhouzi](https://github.com/hongzhouzi)

**Usage Background**

In many application development scenarios, developers need to frequently interact with databases, such as executing SQL statements and viewing table structures. While the existing MCP server supports basic database query functions, it lacks more advanced operation tools. This update adds three tools: `execute` (execute SQL), `list tables` (list tables), and `describe table` (describe table), aiming to meet higher user demands for database management. The target user groups include, but are not limited to, database administrators, backend developers, and application developers who need to frequently interact with databases.

**Feature Details**

Specifically, by modifying the `db.go` file, new database type constants were introduced, and the new tools were registered in the `server.go` file. The newly added tools implement the functionality of executing arbitrary SQL statements, listing all table names, and obtaining detailed information about specific tables. The core technical points lie in using the GORM framework to handle different types of database connections and providing customized SQL query logic for each type of database. Additionally, the code changes also involved optimizing the error handling mechanism, such as unifying the error handling function `handleSQLError`, improving the maintainability of the code. These improvements not only enriched the MCP server's feature set but also enhanced its applicability in various database environments.

**Usage Instructions**

Enabling these new features is straightforward; just ensure that your MCP server configuration includes the correct database DSN and type. For the `execute` tool, users can send requests containing the `sql` parameter to perform INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations; the `list tables` tool requires no additional parameters and can be called directly to return all table names in the current database; the `describe table` tool requires a `table` parameter to specify the table name to view. Typical use cases include, but are not limited to, periodically checking the consistency of database table structures, generating automated scripts, and verifying data before and after migration. It is important to note that when using the `execute` tool, caution should be exercised to avoid executing commands that may compromise data integrity.

**Feature Value**

This feature significantly expands the application scope of the MCP server in database management, enabling users to complete daily tasks more efficiently. It not only simplifies complex manual operations and reduces the likelihood of errors but also provides a solid foundation for building automated O&M processes. Especially for projects that need to work across multiple database platforms, this unified and flexible interface design is undoubtedly a boon. Additionally, by improving error handling logic and adding security measures (such as preventing SQL injection), this PR further ensures the stability and security of the system.

### 2. feat: advanced load balance policies for LLM service through wasm plugin

**Related PR**: [#2531](https://github.com/alibaba/higress/pull/2531) | **Contributor**: [rinfx](https://github.com/rinfx)

**Usage Background**

With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs), the demand for high performance and high availability is growing. Traditional load balancing strategies may not meet these requirements, especially when handling a large number of concurrent requests. The new load balancing strategies aim to address these issues by providing smarter request distribution. The target user group includes enterprises and developers who require high-performance and high-availability LLM services.

**Feature Details**

This PR implements three new load balancing strategies: 1. Minimum Load Strategy, implemented using WASM, suitable for [gateway-api-inference-extension](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api-inference-extension/blob/main/README.md); 2. Global Least Request Strategy based on Redis, which tracks and manages the number of requests for each host via Redis, ensuring that requests are allocated to the host with the least current load; 3. Prompt Prefix Matching Strategy, which selects backend nodes based on prompt prefixes, and if no match is found, uses the Global Least Request Strategy. These strategies are implemented using WASM plugins, providing high scalability and flexibility.

**Usage Instructions**

To enable these load balancing strategies, you need to specify the corresponding strategy type and configuration parameters in the Higress gateway configuration. For example, to enable the Global Least Request Strategy based on Redis, set `lb_policy` to `global_least_request` in the configuration file and provide the FQDN, port, username, and password of the Redis service. For the Prompt Prefix Matching Strategy, set `lb_policy` to `prefix_cache` and make the corresponding configuration. Best practice is to choose the appropriate strategy based on the actual application scenario and regularly monitor and adjust the configuration to optimize performance.

**Feature Value**

These new load balancing strategies bring significant performance improvements to LLM services. The Minimum Load Strategy ensures that requests are allocated to the host with the least current load, thereby improving response speed and resource utilization. The Global Least Request Strategy based on Redis further optimizes resource allocation by tracking the number of requests for each host in real time. The Prompt Prefix Matching Strategy improves processing efficiency by caching and reusing KV Cache. These features not only enhance system performance and stability but also improve user experience, especially in high-concurrency scenarios.
