3. Configure the LLM (Large Language Model) provider and its API key, model name, etc.
4. Configure the embedding model provider and its API key, model name, etc.
5. Configure the vector database provider and its connection information.
Example configuration:
```yaml
rag:
  splitter:
    type: "recursive"
    chunk_size: 500
    chunk_overlap: 50
  top_k: 5
  threshold: 0.5
llm:
  provider: "openai"
  api_key: "your-llm-api-key"
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"

### 2. refactor(mcp): use ECDS for golang filter configuration to avoid connection drain

**Related PR**: [#2931](https://github.com/alibaba/higress/pull/2931) | **Contributor**: [@johnlanni](https://github.com/johnlanni)

**Use Case**

In the current implementation, Golang filter configurations are directly embedded in the HTTP_FILTER patch, which can lead to connection drain when configurations change. The main reason is the inconsistent sorting of Go maps in the `map[string]any` field, and the listener configuration changes triggered by HTTP_FILTER updates. This issue affects the stability and user experience of the system. The target user group is developers and operations personnel using Higress for service mesh management.

**Feature Details**

This PR splits the configuration into two parts: HTTP_FILTER only contains filter references with `config_discovery`, while EXTENSION_CONFIG contains the actual Golang filter configuration. This way, configuration changes do not directly cause connection drain. The specific implementation includes updating the `constructMcpSessionStruct` and `constructMcpServerStruct` methods to return formats compatible with EXTENSION_CONFIG and updating unit tests to match the new configuration structure. The core innovation lies in using the ECDS mechanism to separate configurations, making configuration changes smoother.

**Usage Instructions**

Enabling and configuring this feature does not require any additional operations as it is automatically handled in the background. A typical use case is when configuring Golang filters in Higress; the system will automatically split them into HTTP_FILTER and EXTENSION_CONFIG. Users only need to configure Golang filters as usual. Note that when upgrading to the new version, ensure all related configuration files are updated and thoroughly tested in the production environment to ensure that configuration changes do not introduce other issues.

**Feature Value**

By separating configurations and using ECDS, this feature eliminates the connection drain problem during configuration changes, significantly improving the system's stability and user experience. Additionally, this design makes configurations easier to manage and maintain, reducing potential issues caused by configuration changes. For large-scale service mesh deployments, this improvement is particularly important as it reduces service interruptions caused by configuration changes, thereby enhancing the overall reliability and availability of the system.
