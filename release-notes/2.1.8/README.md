## üåü Detailed Description of Key Features

Here is a detailed explanation of the important features and improvements in this release:

### 1. feat(gzip): add gzip configuration support and update default settings

**Related PR**: [#2867](https://github.com/alibaba/higress/pull/2867) | **Contributor**: [@Aias00](https://github.com/Aias00)

**Usage Background**

In modern web applications, data transmission efficiency is a critical factor. Uncompressed HTTP responses can lead to high bandwidth consumption and long loading times, affecting the user experience. This feature is primarily aimed at developers and operations personnel who need to optimize network performance. It addresses the issue of transmission delays caused by large response data, especially in mobile or low-bandwidth network environments. Additionally, for microservice architectures in cloud-native environments, Gzip compression helps reduce network overhead during cross-service calls, improving overall system response speed.

**Feature Details**

This PR adds Gzip compression configuration support to the Higress gateway and updates the default settings. The specific implementation includes: 1. Adding Gzip-related configuration items in the `helm/core/values.yaml` file, such as whether to enable, minimum content length, etc.; 2. Modifying the default values in the `pkg/ingress/kube/configmap/gzip.go` file to enable Gzip compression by default; 3. Updating relevant test cases to verify the correctness of the new feature. The key technical points lie in reasonably configuring Gzip parameters (e.g., compression level, window size) to balance the relationship between compression ratio and CPU usage, ensuring optimal compression effects without significantly increasing server load.

**Usage Instructions**

To enable and configure Gzip compression, users can customize its behavior by modifying the corresponding fields in the `values.yaml` file. For example, set `gzip.enable: true` to activate the compression feature and adjust `minContentLength` to specify the minimum byte length of content to be compressed. A typical use case is to enable Gzip when deploying new microservices or optimizing the network performance of existing services. Note that while Gzip can effectively reduce the amount of transmitted data, excessive compression may negatively impact server performance, so it is recommended to adjust the compression strategy based on actual circumstances.

**Feature Value**

This feature brings several important advantages to users: 1. Significantly reduces the size of HTTP response data, speeding up page loading and improving the user experience; 2. Reduces network traffic costs, especially suitable for mobile devices or limited bandwidth scenarios; 3. Improves overall system performance, particularly in handling a large number of small file requests. By providing flexible configuration options, administrators can adjust the compression intensity according to actual needs to achieve the best performance. This is crucial for building efficient and responsive web services.

### 2. feat: add rag mcp server

**Related PR**: [#2930](https://github.com/alibaba/higress/pull/2930) | **Contributor**: [@2456868764](https://github.com/2456868764)

**Usage Background**

With the development of large language models (LLMs), knowledge management and retrieval have become increasingly important. Traditional knowledge management systems often struggle with complex text data and lack integration with LLMs. The Higress RAG MCP server addresses this issue by providing a unified interface for managing and retrieving knowledge, integrating multiple LLM providers (such as OpenAI, DashScope, etc.). The target user group includes enterprises, developers, and researchers who need to efficiently manage and retrieve knowledge.

**Feature Details**

The PR implements the RAG MCP server, adding multiple new files and dependencies. The main features include knowledge management (creating, deleting, and listing knowledge blocks), search, and chat functionalities. Key technical points include using a recursive chunker to split text, supporting multiple embedding models (such as OpenAI and DashScope), and integrating with vector databases (such as Milvus). The code changes include adding multiple Go module dependencies, such as `github.com/dlclark/regexp2`, `github.com/milvus-io/milvus-sdk-go/v2`, and `github.com/pkoukk/tiktoken-go`, which are used for regular expression processing, vector database operations, and text encoding, respectively. Additionally, new HTTP clients and configuration structures were added to ensure the flexibility and configurability of the system.

**Usage Instructions**

To enable and configure the RAG MCP server, first, enable the MCP server in the `higress-config` ConfigMap and set the corresponding path and matching rules. Then, configure the basic parameters of the RAG system, such as the chunker type, block size, and overlap, as well as the relevant information for LLM and embedding models. Typical use cases include creating knowledge blocks from text, searching for related knowledge, and interacting with LLMs through chat. For example, you can create knowledge blocks by sending a POST request to `/mcp-servers/rag/create-chunks-from-text` or perform a search via `/mcp-servers/rag/search`. Be sure to check the required fields in the configuration file, such as API keys and model names, to avoid runtime errors.

**Feature Value**

The RAG MCP server provides powerful knowledge management and retrieval capabilities, significantly enhancing the intelligence of the system. By integrating multiple LLMs and embedding models, users can choose the most suitable tools based on their specific needs. Additionally, flexible configuration options allow the system to adapt to different network environments and data scales. This feature not only improves system performance and stability but also enhances the user experience, making knowledge management and retrieval more efficient and convenient. For the ecosystem, the RAG MCP server adds new core functionalities to the Higress platform, further solidifying its leading position in the field of intelligent applications.

### 3. refactor(mcp): use ECDS for golang filter configuration to avoid connection drain

**Related PR**: [#2931](https://github.com/alibaba/higress/pull/2931) | **Contributor**: [@johnlanni](https://github.com/johnlanni)

**Usage Background**

In the current implementation, the golang filter configuration is directly embedded into the HTTP_FILTER patch. This leads to connection drain issues when the configuration changes, primarily due to the inconsistent order of Go maps and the listener configuration changes triggered by HTTP_FILTER updates. To address this, the PR introduces the Extension Configuration Discovery Service (ECDS) to separate the HTTP_FILTER from the actual golang filter configuration. The target user group mainly includes network service operations personnel who require high availability and low latency.

**Feature Details**

This refactoring separates the configuration into two parts: the HTTP_FILTER contains only filters with config_discovery references, while the EXTENSION_CONFIG contains the actual golang filter configuration. Specifically, the `constructMcpSessionStruct` and `constructMcpServerStruct` methods were updated to return a format compatible with EXTENSION_CONFIG. Additionally, unit tests were updated to match the new configuration structure. This technical improvement uses ECDS to decouple filter configuration from HTTP_FILTER, thereby avoiding connection drain issues caused by configuration changes.

**Usage Instructions**

To enable this feature, users do not need to make any additional configurations, as this is an internal implementation change. A typical use case is when users need to frequently update golang filter configurations, and the system can automatically handle configuration updates without affecting existing connections. However, users should ensure that their environment supports ECDS and that the related Envoy proxy version is compatible. Best practices recommend regularly checking logs and monitoring data to verify the stability of connections during configuration updates.

**Feature Value**

This refactoring significantly improves the system's stability and reliability by eliminating connection drain issues during configuration changes, making the system more robust. For applications that rely on low latency and high availability, this is particularly important. Additionally, using ECDS enhances the maintainability and scalability of the code, laying a good foundation for future feature development. Overall, this change not only solves existing problems but also brings long-term benefits to the entire ecosystem.

The specific steps to enable and configure this feature are as follows:
1. Find the relevant settings section for the OpenAI LLM provider in the configuration file.
2. Add or modify the `openaiCustomServiceHost` and `openaiCustomServicePath` fields to specify the hostname and path of the custom service, respectively. For example:
   ```json
   {
     "provider": "OpenAI",
     "openaiCustomServiceHost": "api.openai.internal",
     "openaiCustomServicePath": "/v1"
   }
   ```
3. If further control over internal resource management is needed, pass the `internal` parameter when deleting Wasm plugin instances, such as `wasmPluginInstanceService.delete(WasmPluginInstanceScope.ROUTE, routeName, BuiltInPluginName.MODEL_MAPPER, true);`.
4. The system will automatically connect to the specified service address based on the provided custom service configuration, thus achieving a more flexible integration approach. Precautions include ensuring the validity and reachability of the custom service address and properly configuring related security policies.

**Feature Value**

This new feature brings significant benefits to users:
1. **Increased Flexibility**: Users can choose different OpenAI service configuration methods according to their needs, whether using external services or internal proxies.
2. **Performance Optimization**: By using internal proxies or local mirror services, network latency can be reduced, and response speed improved.
3. **Enhanced Security**: For enterprises with strict security requirements, accessing OpenAI services through the internal network helps ensure the security of data transmission.
4. **Better User Experience**: The frontend interface provides corresponding multilingual support, ensuring that users can smoothly configure and use this feature in different language environments.
