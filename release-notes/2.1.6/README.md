## üåü Detailed Description of Key Features

Below are the detailed descriptions of the important features and improvements in this release:

### 1. feat: Add Higress API MCP server

**Related PR**: [#2517](https://github.com/alibaba/higress/pull/2517) | **Contributor**: [@cr7258](https://github.com/cr7258)

**Usage Background**

In modern microservice architectures, the API gateway, as the entry point, requires flexible and powerful configuration management capabilities. Higress, as a high-performance API gateway, provides rich features for managing routes, service origins, and plugins. However, the existing configuration management methods may not be flexible enough to meet complex operational needs. To address this issue, PR #2517 introduces the Higress API MCP Server, providing a new way to manage configurations through the Higress Console API. This feature is primarily aimed at operations personnel and developers who need advanced and dynamic management of Higress.

**Feature Details**

This change implements the Higress API MCP Server, re-implementing an MCP server using golang-filter that can call the Higress Console API to manage routes, service origins, and plugins. The specific implementation includes:
1. Added the HigressClient class to handle interactions with the Higress Console API.
2. Implemented various management tools such as route management (list-routes, get-route, add-route, update-route), service origin management (list-service-sources, get-service-source, add-service-source, update-service-source), and plugin management (get-plugin, delete-plugin, update-request-block-plugin).
3. Modified relevant configuration files and README documentation, providing detailed configuration examples and usage instructions.
4. Code changes involve multiple files, including `config.go`, `client.go`, `server.go`, etc., ensuring the completeness and extensibility of the feature.

**Usage Instructions**

To enable and configure the Higress API MCP Server, follow these steps:
1. Add the MCP Server configuration in the Higress ConfigMap, specifying the URL, username, and password of the Higress Console.
2. When starting the Higress Gateway, ensure that `mcpServer.enable` is set to `true`.
3. Use the provided tool commands (e.g., `list-routes`, `add-route`) to manage routes, service origins, and plugins.
4. Configuration example:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: higress-config
  namespace: higress-system
data:
  higress: |-
    mcpServer:
      sse_path_suffix: /sse
      enable: true
      servers:
        - name: higress-api-mcp-server
          path: /higress-api
          type: higress-api
          config:
            higressURL: http://higress-console.higress-system.svc.cluster.local
            username: admin
            password: <password>
```
Notes:
- Ensure that the Higress Console URL, username, and password are correct.
- It is recommended to use environment variables or encrypted storage for the password to enhance security.

**Feature Value**

The Higress API MCP Server brings the following specific benefits to users:
1. **Improved Operational Efficiency**: Through a unified MCP interface, users can more conveniently manage and configure Higress resources via AI Agent, reducing the complexity and error rate of manual operations.
2. **Enhanced System Flexibility**: Support for dynamic management and updating of routes, service origins, and plugins makes the system more flexible and able to quickly respond to changes in business requirements.
3. **Increased System Stability**: Automated configuration management reduces the possibility of human errors, thereby enhancing the stability and reliability of the system.
4. **Easy Integration**: The design of the Higress API MCP Server makes it easy to integrate with other AI agents and tools, facilitating the construction of a complete automated operations system.

### 2. Migrate WASM Go Plugins to New SDK and Go 1.24

**Related PR**: [#2532](https://github.com/alibaba/higress/pull/2532) | **Contributor**: [@erasernoob](https://github.com/erasernoob)

**Usage Background**

With the development of the Go language, new versions provide many performance optimizations and security improvements. This PR aims to migrate WASM Go plugins from the old SDK to the new SDK and upgrade the Go version to 1.24. This not only resolves some known issues in the old version but also paves the way for future feature expansion and performance optimization. The target user group includes developers and operations personnel using Higress for microservice management and traffic control.

**Feature Details**

This PR mainly implements the following features: 1) Updated the workflow files for building and testing plugins to support the new Go version; 2) Modified the Dockerfile and Makefile, removing support for TinyGo and switching to the standard Go compiler for generating WASM files; 3) Updated the go.mod file, referencing new package paths and versions; 4) Adjusted the import path of the logging library, unifying the use of the new logging library. These changes allow the plugins to better utilize the new features of Go 1.24, such as improved garbage collection and more efficient compiler optimizations. Additionally, removing support for TinyGo simplifies the build process and reduces potential compatibility issues.

**Usage Instructions**

To enable and configure this feature, first ensure that your development environment has Go 1.24 installed. Then, you can specify the new build parameters by modifying the project's Makefile and Dockerfile. For example, set `GO_VERSION ?= 1.24.4` in the Makefile and use `ARG BUILDER=higress-registry.cn-hangzhou.cr.aliyuncs.com/plugins/wasm-go-builder:go1.24.4-oras1.0.0` in the Dockerfile. A typical use case is when you need to deploy new WASM plugins in Higress. Best practices include regularly updating dependencies to the latest versions and ensuring that all related code is adapted to the new version.

**Feature Value**

This refactoring brings multiple benefits to users: 1) Improved plugin runtime efficiency and stability, thanks to the new features and optimizations in Go 1.24; 2) Simplified build process, reducing dependency on third-party tools (such as TinyGo) and lowering maintenance costs; 3) Unified code style and dependency management, improving the readability and maintainability of the project; 4) Enhanced system security by adopting the latest Go version to fix known security vulnerabilities. These improvements make the Higress ecosystem more robust, providing a more powerful and reliable microservice management platform for users.
