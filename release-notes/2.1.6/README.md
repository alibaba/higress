## üåü Detailed Description of Important Features

Below are the detailed descriptions of the key features and improvements in this release:

### 1. feat: Add Higress API MCP server

**Related PR**: [#2517](https://github.com/alibaba/higress/pull/2517) | **Contributor**: [cr7258](https://github.com/cr7258)

**Usage Background**

In a microservices architecture, effective route and service management is crucial. Higress, as a high-performance API gateway, requires a powerful tool to manage its internal resources. The existing management methods may lack flexibility or be difficult to scale. To address this issue, PR #2517 introduces a new Higress API MCP Server, which centralizes the management of routes, service origins, and plugins by calling the Higress Console API. This not only improves the system's operability but also enhances the user experience, particularly for operations teams that need to frequently adjust and optimize API gateway configurations.

**Feature Details**

This feature re-implements the Higress Ops MCP Server using golang-filter and adds the Higress API MCP Server. The main technical implementation includes:
1. Writing the `HigressClient` in Go, supporting basic HTTP operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
2. Implementing multiple API tools, such as route management (list-routes, get-route, add-route, update-route), service origin management (list-service-sources, get-service-source, add-service-source, update-service-source), and plugin management (get-plugin, delete-plugin, update-request-block-plugin).
3. Providing detailed configuration parameter descriptions, including the Higress Console URL, username, and password.
4. Code changes involve multiple files, including README documentation, configuration files, client implementation, and tool registration, totaling 1546 lines of code changes.

**Usage Instructions**

To enable and configure the Higress API MCP Server, follow these steps:
1. Add the relevant MCP Server configuration to the Higress Gateway configuration file, such as setting the `higressURL`, `username`, and `password` parameters.
2. When building the Higress Gateway image, ensure that the `golang-filter.so` plugin is included, using the `make build-gateway-local` command.
3. After starting the Higress Gateway, access the Higress API MCP Server through the configured path, e.g., `/higress-api`.
4. Use the provided API tools to manage routes, service origins, and plugins. For example, use `list-routes` to get all route information and `add-route` to add a new route.
**Notes**:
- Ensure that the Higress Console URL, username, and password are correct.
- In a production environment, it is recommended to use environment variables or encrypted storage to protect sensitive information.
- Follow best practices and regularly check and update configurations to maintain system security and stability.

**Feature Value**

The Higress API MCP Server brings the following significant advantages:
1. **Enhanced Management Efficiency**: Through a unified API interface, users can easily manage and configure various Higress resources, reducing the time and complexity of manual operations.
2. **Increased System Flexibility**: Supports dynamic adjustments to routes and service origins, allowing the system to quickly respond to changes in business needs.
3. **Improved Security**: Through strict parameter validation and error handling mechanisms, the system's stability and security are ensured.
4. **Simplified Operations**: Provides detailed logging and error handling, making it easier for operators to quickly locate and resolve issues.
5. **Promotes Ecosystem Development**: As part of the Higress ecosystem, this feature will further drive community development and improvement, providing users with more convenient tools and solutions.

### 2. Migrate WASM Go Plugins to New SDK and Go 1.24

**Related PR**: [#2532](https://github.com/alibaba/higress/pull/2532) | **Contributor**: [erasernoob](https://github.com/erasernoob)

**Usage Background**

This PR addresses the issues encountered when using the old Go SDK and lower versions of the Go language. With the release of Go 1.24, the new version offers better performance, security, and stability. Additionally, the new WASM Go SDK brings more features and improvements. The target user group is developers who use Higress for WebAssembly plugin development, who need a more modern and efficient development environment. Furthermore, for maintainers, a unified dependency management and build process can reduce maintenance costs.

**Feature Details**

Specifically, this update migrates all WASM Go plugins from the old SDK to the new SDK and upgrades the Go version to 1.24. The main technical points include:
1. Updating the Dockerfile and GitHub Actions workflows to support the new Go version and build parameters.
2. Modifying the go.mod file to update dependencies and remove unnecessary ones.
3. Fixing log type mismatch issues caused by changes in the logging package.
4. Optimizing the build script by removing unnecessary main functions and ensuring that the init() function complies with the proxy-wasm-go-sdk specification.
5. Adding resource cleanup and error handling logic to improve code robustness.

**Usage Instructions**

To enable and configure this feature, users need to update the relevant files in their projects:
1. Update the Dockerfile to use new build parameters (e.g., GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm).
2. Update the go.mod file to ensure the Go version is 1.24 and remove any unnecessary dependencies.
3. Update log calls in the project to use the new logger instance.
4. Check all callback functions and method parameters to ensure they match the new log types and other parameter orders.
**Typical Use Cases**:
- Developing new WASM Go plugins
- Upgrading existing plugins to take advantage of the new version's performance and features
**Notes**:
- Ensure all dependencies are updated, and there are no missing old dependency hashes.
- Check all log calls and callback functions to ensure type and parameter order consistency.

**Feature Value**

This update brings the following benefits to users:
1. **Performance Improvement**: Go 1.24 brings significant performance improvements, especially in concurrency and memory management, making plugins run faster and more efficiently.
2. **Enhanced Stability**: The new SDK and Go version provide better error handling and resource management, reducing the risk of runtime crashes.
3. **Strengthened Security**: The new versions of Go and the SDK fix multiple security vulnerabilities, enhancing the security of the plugins.
4. **Ease of Use**: A unified dependency management and build process simplify the development and deployment process, reducing maintenance costs.
5. **Ecosystem Compatibility**: By adopting the latest SDK and toolchain, plugins can better integrate with other modern WebAssembly ecosystem components, enhancing the interoperability of the entire ecosystem.
