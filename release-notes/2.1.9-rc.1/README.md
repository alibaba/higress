## üåü Important Feature Details

Below are detailed explanations of key features and improvements in this release:

### 1. feat: Support using a known service in OpenAI LLM provider

**Related PR**: [#589](https://github.com/higress-group/higress-console/pull/589) | **Contributor**: [@CH3CHO](https://github.com/CH3CHO)

**Usage Background**

As more organizations and services adopt large language models (LLMs), access and management of these models have become increasingly important. Especially when integration with specific known services, such as an on-premises OpenAI API server or a custom API endpoint, is required. This feature addresses the need for direct support of custom OpenAI services within the Higress system, allowing users to more flexibly configure and use their services. The target user groups include, but are not limited to, developers, operations personnel, and enterprises requiring highly customized solutions.

**Feature Details**

The update primarily focuses on the `OpenaiLlmProviderHandler` class, introducing support for custom service sources. By adding new configuration options like `openaiCustomServiceName` and `openaiCustomServicePort`, users can now directly specify the details of their custom OpenAI service. Additionally, the code has been improved so that if a custom upstream service is specified, a service source will not be created for the default service. This design not only simplifies the configuration process but also enhances the system's scalability. Technically, this is achieved by overriding the `buildServiceSource` and `buildUpstreamService` methods, which include checks for user-defined settings.

**Usage Instructions**

To enable and configure this new feature, users first need to provide the necessary custom service information in their OpenAI LLM provider settings. This typically involves filling in fields such as the custom service name, host address, and port number. The general steps are: 1. Locate the relevant LLM provider settings section in the Higress console or corresponding configuration file; 2. Enter the appropriate custom service details as prompted; 3. Save the changes. A typical use case might be a company wishing to use its own internally hosted OpenAI interface instead of the publicly available one. It is important to ensure that the provided custom service address is accurate and network-accessible.

**Feature Value**

This feature greatly enhances the adaptability of the Higress platform to different environments, especially for scenarios requiring high levels of customization. It not only improves the user experience‚Äîmaking the configuration process more intuitive and simple‚Äîbut also promotes the overall stability and security of the system, as it now allows for the direct use of trusted internal resources. In the long run, such enhancements help build a more robust ecosystem, encouraging more innovative application development.
