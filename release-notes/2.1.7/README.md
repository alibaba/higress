## üåü Detailed Description of Important Features

Here are the detailed descriptions of important features and improvements in this release:

### 1. feat: add MCP SSE stateful session load balancer support

**Related PR**: [#2818](https://github.com/alibaba/higress/pull/2818) | **Contributor**: [@johnlanni](https://github.com/johnlanni)

**Usage Background**

As the demand for real-time communication grows, Server-Sent Events (SSE) have become a key technology for many applications. However, in distributed systems, ensuring that requests from the same client are always routed to the same backend service to maintain session state has been a challenge. Traditional load balancing strategies cannot meet this need. This feature addresses this issue by introducing MCP SSE stateful session load balancing support. By specifying the `mcp-sse` type in the `higress.io/load-balance` annotation, users can easily manage SSE connection state sessions. The target user group mainly consists of application developers and service providers who need to perform real-time data pushing in distributed environments.

**Feature Details**

This PR mainly implements the following features:
1. **Extend `load-balance` annotation**: In the `loadbalance.go` file, support for the `mcp-sse` value is added, and the `McpSseStateful` field is added to the `LoadBalanceConfig` struct.
2. **Simplified Configuration**: Users only need to set `mcp-sse` in the `higress.io/load-balance` annotation to enable this feature, with no additional configuration required.
3. **Backend Address Encoding**: When MCP SSE stateful session load balancing is enabled, the backend address will be Base64 encoded and embedded in the session ID of the SSE message. This ensures that the client can correctly identify and maintain the session. The core innovation lies in dynamically generating SSE session-related configurations through EnvoyFilter, thereby achieving stateful session management.

**Usage Instructions**

To use this feature, users need to follow these steps:
1. **Enable the Feature**: Add the `higress.io/load-balance: mcp-sse` annotation to the Ingress resource.
2. **Configuration Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: sse-ingress
  annotations:
    higress.io/load-balance: mcp-sse
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /mcp-servers/test/sse
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: sse-service
            port:
              number: 80
```
3. **Testing**: Access the SSE endpoint using the `curl` command and check if the returned messages contain the correct session ID.
**Notes**:
- Ensure that the backend service can handle Base64 encoded session IDs.
- Avoid frequent changes to the backend service deployment to prevent session consistency issues.

**Feature Value**

This feature brings the following specific benefits to users:
1. **Session Consistency**: Ensures that requests from the same client are always routed to the same backend service, maintaining session state consistency.
2. **Simplified Configuration**: Enables the feature with simple annotation configuration, reducing the complexity of user configuration.
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: For applications that rely on SSE, such as real-time notifications and stock market data, it provides a more stable and consistent service experience.
4. **Reduced Operations Costs**: Reduces errors and failures caused by inconsistent sessions, lowering the workload of the operations team.

### 2. feat: Support adding a proxy server in between when forwarding requests to upstream

**Related PR**: [#2710](https://github.com/alibaba/higress/pull/2710) | **Contributor**: [@CH3CHO](https://github.com/CH3CHO)

**Usage Background**

In modern microservice architectures, especially in complex network environments, directly forwarding requests from the client to the backend service may encounter various issues, such as network security and performance bottlenecks. Introducing an intermediate proxy server can effectively solve these problems, for example, by performing traffic control, load balancing, and SSL offloading through the proxy server. Additionally, in some cases, enterprises may need to use specific proxy servers to meet compliance and security requirements. The target user group for this feature mainly consists of enterprises and developers who need to optimize request forwarding paths in complex network environments.

**Feature Details**

This PR mainly implements the ability to configure one or more proxy servers in the McpBridge resource and allows specifying proxy servers for each registry. The specific implementation includes: 
1. Adding the `proxies` field in the `McpBridge` resource definition to configure the list of proxy servers, and adding the `proxyName` field in the `registries` item to associate the proxy server with the registry.
2. When creating or updating the `McpBridge` resource, the system automatically generates the corresponding EnvoyFilter resources, which define how to forward requests to the specified proxy server.
3. Additionally, EnvoyFilters are generated for each service bound to a proxy, ensuring they correctly point to the local listener on the corresponding proxy server. The entire technical implementation is based on Envoy's advanced routing capabilities, demonstrating the project's powerful functionality in handling complex network topologies.

**Usage Instructions**

To enable this feature, at least one proxy server must first be configured in the `McpBridge` resource. This can be done by adding new `ProxyConfig` objects to the `spec.proxies` array, each containing necessary information such as `name`, `serverAddress`, and `serverPort`. Next, for the registry entries that need to use a proxy server, simply reference the defined proxy name in their `proxyName` field. Once configured, the system will automatically handle all related EnvoyFilter generation work. It is worth noting that before actual deployment, the correctness of the configuration files should be carefully checked to avoid service unavailability due to misconfiguration.

**Feature Value**

The newly added proxy server support feature greatly enhances the system's network flexibility, allowing users to flexibly adjust request forwarding paths according to their needs. For example, by setting up different proxy servers, it is easy to achieve data transmission optimization across multiple regions; at the same time, with the additional security features provided by the proxy layer (such as SSL encryption), the overall system security is significantly improved. In addition, this feature also helps simplify operations management, especially in situations where frequent adjustments to the network architecture are needed. Through simple configuration changes, rapid responses to changes can be achieved without major modifications to the underlying infrastructure. In summary, this improvement not only expands the project's scope but also provides users with more powerful tools to tackle increasingly complex network challenges.

### 3. feat(ai-proxy): add auto protocol compatibility for OpenAI and Claude APIs

**Related PR**: [#2810](https://github.com/alibaba/higress/pull/2810) | **Contributor**: [@johnlanni](https://github.com/johnlanni)

**Usage Background**

In the AI proxy plugin, users may need to interact with multiple AI service providers (such as OpenAI and Anthropic Claude) simultaneously. These providers typically use different API protocols, leading to the need for manual configuration of protocol types when switching services, which increases complexity and the likelihood of errors. This feature solves this problem, allowing users to seamlessly use different providers' services without worrying about the differences in underlying protocols. The target user group consists of developers and enterprises who want to simplify the AI service integration process.

**Feature Details**

This PR implements the automatic protocol compatibility feature. The core technological innovation lies in automatically detecting the request path and intelligently converting the protocol based on the target provider's capabilities. Specifically, when the request path is `/v1/chat/completions`, it is recognized as the OpenAI protocol; when the request path is `/v1/messages`, it is recognized as the Claude protocol. If the target provider does not support the native Claude protocol, the plugin converts the request from Claude format to OpenAI format, and vice versa. In the `main.go` file, new logic for automatic protocol detection based on the request path is added, and path replacements are made as necessary. Additionally, a new `claude_to_openai.go` file is added to implement the specific conversion logic from Claude to OpenAI protocol.

**Usage Instructions**

Enabling this feature is very simple; users just need to send requests as usual, with no additional configuration required. For example, for OpenAI protocol requests, the URL is `http://your-domain/v1/chat/completions`, and for Claude protocol requests, the URL is `http://your-domain/v1/messages`. The plugin will automatically detect and handle protocol conversion. If the target provider does not support the Claude protocol, the plugin will convert it to OpenAI format. Example configuration is as follows:

```yaml
provider:
  type: claude  # Provider natively supporting the Claude protocol
  apiTokens:
    - 'YOUR_CLAUDE_API_TOKEN'
  version: '2023-06-01'
```

**Notes**: Ensure that the API token and version number are correctly configured so that the plugin can correctly identify and process the requests.

**Feature Value**

This feature significantly improves the usability and flexibility of the AI proxy plugin, reducing the user's configuration burden. Through automatic protocol detection and intelligent conversion, users can more easily switch between different AI service providers without worrying about protocol compatibility issues. This not only improves development efficiency but also enhances the stability and reliability of the system. Additionally, the feature supports streaming responses, further expanding its application scenarios, especially in cases requiring real-time interaction. In summary, this feature provides users with a more efficient and convenient way to integrate and manage multiple AI service providers.
