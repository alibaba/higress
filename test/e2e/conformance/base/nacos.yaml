# This file contains the base resources that most conformance tests will rely
# on. This includes 3 namespaces along with Gateways, Services and Deployments
# that can be used as backends for routing traffic. The most important
# resources included are the Gateways (all in the higress-conformance-infra
# namespace):
# - same-namespace (only supports route in same ns)
# - all-namespaces (supports routes in all ns)
# - backend-namespaces (supports routes in ns with backend label)
