## Function Description
The `model-mapper` plugin supports bidirectional mapping of the `model` field in LLM protocols:

- Request direction: rewrites client model names to upstream model names.
- Response direction: rewrites upstream model names back to the original client model names (supports both JSON and SSE responses).

## Runtime Properties

Plugin execution phase: Authentication phase
Plugin execution priority: 800

## Effect Description

With the following configuration:

```yaml
modelMapping:
  'gpt-4-*': "qwen-max"
  'gpt-4o': "qwen-vl-plus"
  '*': "qwen-turbo"
```

After enabling, model parameters starting with `gpt-4-` will be rewritten to `qwen-max`, `gpt-4o` will be rewritten to `qwen-vl-plus`, and all other models will be rewritten to `qwen-turbo`.

For example, if the original request was:

```json
{
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "frequency_penalty": 0,
    "max_tokens": 800,
    "stream": false,
    "messages": [{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is the GitHub address of the main repository for the higress project?"
    }],
    "presence_penalty": 0,
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "top_p": 0.95
}
```


After processing by this plugin, the original LLM request body will be modified to:

```json
{
    "model": "qwen-vl-plus",
    "frequency_penalty": 0,
    "max_tokens": 800,
    "stream": false,
    "messages": [{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is the GitHub address of the main repository for the higress project?"
    }],
    "presence_penalty": 0,
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "top_p": 0.95
}
```

If the upstream response `model` is `qwen-vl-plus`, the plugin will rewrite it back to `gpt-4o` before returning to the client.

### Streaming Response (SSE)

For `text/event-stream` responses, the plugin incrementally processes JSON in SSE `data:` lines and rewrites the `model` field.

For example, upstream event:

```text
event: message_start
data: {"type":"message_start","message":{"model":"qwen-vl-plus"}}
```

Returned to the client:

```text
event: message_start
data: {"type":"message_start","message":{"model":"gpt-4o"}}
```

## Notes

- Response rewrite is enabled only when request model rewrite happened for the same stream.
- Response rewrite is applied only when the response model value exactly matches the mapped upstream model, to avoid unintended rewrites.
- Avoid enabling multiple plugins that rewrite `model` simultaneously, or make sure plugin execution order is explicitly controlled.
