| block_bodies       | array of string     | Optional, at least one of `block_urls`, `block_headers`, `block_bodies` must be filled | -             | Configure strings for matching request bodies that need to be blocked |
| blocked_code       | number             | Optional                                                | 403           | Configure the HTTP status code returned when a request is blocked |

## Configuration Example
### Blocking Request URL Paths
```yaml
block_urls:
- swagger.html
- foo=bar
case_sensitive: false
```

Based on this configuration, the following requests will be denied access:
```bash
curl http://example.com?foo=Bar
curl http://exmaple.com/Swagger.html
```

### Blocking Request Headers
```yaml
block_headers:
- example-key
- example-value
```

Based on this configuration, the following requests will be denied access:
```bash
curl http://example.com -H 'example-key: 123'
curl http://exmaple.com -H 'my-header: example-value'
```

### Blocking Request Bodies
```yaml
block_bodies:
- "hello world"
case_sensitive: false
```

Based on this configuration, the following requests will be denied access:
```bash
curl http://example.com -d 'Hello World'
curl http://exmaple.com -d 'hello world'
```

## Request Body Size Limit
When `block_bodies` is configured, only request bodies smaller than 32 MB are supported for matching. If the request body exceeds this limit and there are no matching `block_urls` or `block_headers`, the blocking operation will not be executed for that request.

When `block_bodies` is configured and the request body exceeds the global configuration DownstreamConnectionBufferLimits, it will return `413 Payload Too Large`.
