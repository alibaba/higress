## Introduction
Integrate with Aliyun content security service for detections of input and output of LLMs, ensuring that application content is legal and compliant.

## Runtime Properties

Plugin Phase: `CUSTOM`
Plugin Priority: `300`

## Configuration

| `action` | string | required | - | Aliyun ai guardrails business interface |
| `checkRequest` | bool | optional | false | check if the input is legal |
| `checkResponse` | bool | optional | false | check if the output is legal |
| `requestCheckService` | string | optional | llm_query_moderation | Aliyun yundun service name for input check |
| `responseCheckService` | string | optional | llm_response_moderation | Aliyun yundun service name for output check |

| `responseStreamContentJsonPath` | string | optional | `choices.0.delta.content` | Specify the jsonpath of the content to be detected in the streaming response body |
| `responseContentFallbackJsonPaths` | array | optional | [`choices.0.message.content`, `content.#(type=="text")#.text`] | Fallback paths tried in order when `responseContentJsonPath` extracts empty content; entries equal to the primary path are skipped automatically; set to `[]` to disable fallback explicitly |
| `responseStreamContentFallbackJsonPaths` | array | optional | [`choices.0.delta.content`, `delta.text`] | Streaming fallback paths tried in order when `responseStreamContentJsonPath` extracts empty content; entries equal to the primary path are skipped automatically; set to `[]` to disable fallback explicitly |
| `denyCode` | int | optional | 200 | Response status code when the specified content is illegal |
| `denyMessage` | string | optional | Drainage/non-streaming response in openai format, the answer content is the suggested answer from Alibaba Cloud content security | Response content when the specified content is illegal |
| `protocol` | string | optional | openai | protocol format, `openai` or `original` |
| `openAIDenyResponseFormat` | string | optional | legacy | OpenAI-wrapped deny response format, `legacy` or `structured`. The default `legacy` preserves historical compatibility; `structured` embeds blocking details at `choices[0].x_higress_guardrail` |
| `contentModerationLevelBar` | string | optional | max | contentModeration risk level threshold, `max`, `high`, `medium` or `low` |

| `customLabelLevelBar` | string | optional | max | Custom label detection risk level threshold, value can be max, high, medium, or low |
| `riskAction` | string | optional | block | Risk action, value can be `block` or `mask`. `block` means blocking requests based on risk level thresholds, `mask` means replacing sensitive fields with desensitized content when API returns mask suggestion. Note: masking only works with MultiModalGuard mode |
| `timeout` | int | optional | 2000 | timeout for lvwang service |
| `bufferLimit` | int | optional | 1000 | Limit the length of each text when calling the lvwang service |
| `consumerRequestCheckService` | map | optional | - | Specify specific request detection services for different consumers |
| `consumerResponseCheckService` | map | optional | - | Specify specific response detection services for different consumers |
| `consumerRiskLevel` | map | optional | - | Specify interception risk levels for different consumers in different dimensions |

Risk level explanations for each detection dimension:

- For content moderation and prompt attack detection (contentModeration, promptAttack):
    - `max`: Detect request/response content but do not block
    - `high`: Block when risk level is `high`
    - `medium`: Block when risk level >= `medium`
    - `low`: Block when risk level >= `low`

- For sensitive data detection (sensitiveData):
    - `S4`: Detect request/response content but do not block
    - `S3`: Block when risk level is `S3`
    - `S2`: Block when risk level >= `S2`
    - `S1`: Block when risk level >= `S1`

- For custom label detection (customLabel):
    - `max`: Detect request/response content but do not block
    - `high`: Block when custom label detection result risk level is `high`
    - Note: The Alibaba Cloud API only returns `high` and `none` for the customLabel dimension, unlike other dimensions which have four levels. Set to `high` to block on detection hit, set to `max` to not block. `medium` and `low` are kept for configuration compatibility but will not be returned by the API.

- For risk action (riskAction):
    - `block`: Block requests based on risk level thresholds for each dimension
    - `mask`: Replace sensitive fields with desensitized content when API returns `Suggestion=mask`, still block when `Suggestion=block`
    - Note: Masking only works with MultiModalGuard mode (action configured as MultiModalGuard), other modes do not support masking

### Deny Response Body

When content is blocked, the plugin (`MultiModalGuard` action) builds the following structured JSON object. `protocol: original`, MCP, and image-generation paths return it directly or indirectly; OpenAI text-generation wrapping keeps the historical response shape by default, and embeds this object only when `openAIDenyResponseFormat: structured` is configured.

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "denyMessage": "Sorry, I cannot answer your question.",
  "blockedDetails": [
    {
      "type": "contentModeration",
      "level": "high"
    }
  ]
}
```

Field descriptions:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `code` | int | For `text_generation` (OpenAI wrapping) and `image_generation` paths, this is the HTTP status the gateway returns, sourced from `denyCode` (default `200`). For `protocol=original` and `mcp` paths, this is the business code returned by the security service (`Response.Code`; `200` indicates a successful check that detected a risk). |
| `denyMessage` | string | Human-readable deny text. Always present on OpenAI-wrapping paths, taken from `denyMessage` (defaults to `Sorry, I cannot answer your question.`). On `protocol=original` / `image_generation` / `mcp` paths the value is taken from `denyMessage` and omitted (`omitempty`) when unconfigured. |
| `blockedDetails` | array | Details of the triggered blocking dimensions. Synthesised from top-level `RiskLevel`/`AttackLevel` when the security service returns no `Detail` entries. Returns `[]` when no dimension is hit. |
| `blockedDetails[].type` | string | Risk type: `contentModeration` / `promptAttack` / `sensitiveData` / `maliciousUrl` / `modelHallucination` / `customLabel` |
| `blockedDetails[].level` | string | Risk level: `high` / `medium` / `low`; for sensitive data: `S1`–`S4` |

> Note: the current implementation emits only the fields above. The security service's `RequestId`, per-detail `Suggestion`, and raw business code (`guardCode`) are not embedded in the deny body. The security service's `RequestId` is exposed via the AI access log field `safecheck_request_ids` (see the AI Log section below).

How the body is embedded per protocol:

- **`text_generation` (OpenAI, default `legacy`)**: emits neither `x_higress_guardrail` nor the historical `x_higress` field; `choices[0].message.content` / the first `delta.content` frame keeps the historical content shape (a JSON string for RiskBlock, deny text for mask fallback), `finish_reason` is `"stop"`, and streaming responses still end with `data: [DONE]`
- **`text_generation` (OpenAI, `structured` non-streaming)**: `choices[0].message.content` carries the human-readable deny text (`denyMessage`, defaults to `Sorry, I cannot answer your question.` when unconfigured); the structure above is placed at `choices[0].x_higress_guardrail` as an embedded object (not a JSON string)
- **`text_generation` (OpenAI, `structured` streaming SSE)**: the first frame's `delta.content` carries the human-readable deny text; the structure above is attached only to the last chunk at `choices[0].x_higress_guardrail` as an embedded object, followed by `data: [DONE]`
- **`text_generation` (`protocol=original`)**: returned directly as the JSON response body (no OpenAI wrapper, no `x_higress_guardrail`)
- **`image_generation`**: returned directly as the JSON response body (HTTP 403)
- **`mcp` (JSON-RPC)**: serialised as a JSON string and placed in `error.message`
- **`mcp` (SSE)**: same, returned via SSE event

`openAIDenyResponseFormat` only changes the OpenAI-wrapped deny body shape; blocking decisions, fail-open behavior, metrics, and AI Log fields do not vary by format. Configure this field only at plugin global scope, not under `consumerRiskLevel`.

## Examples of configuration
### Check if the input is legal

```yaml
serviceName: safecheck.dns
servicePort: 443
serviceHost: "green-cip.cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com"
accessKey: "XXXXXXXXX"
secretKey: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
checkRequest: true
```

### Check if both the input and output are legal

```yaml
serviceName: safecheck.dns
servicePort: 443
serviceHost: green-cip.cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com
accessKey: "XXXXXXXXX"
secretKey: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
checkRequest: true
checkResponse: true
```

### Configure OpenAI Structured Deny Responses

The default `openAIDenyResponseFormat: legacy` keeps the historical response shape. To emit structured blocking details in OpenAI responses, configure:

```yaml
openAIDenyResponseFormat: structured
```

### Configure response fallback extraction paths

When primary extraction paths are empty, you can configure ordered fallback paths to support multiple response formats:

```yaml
serviceName: safecheck.dns
servicePort: 443
serviceHost: green-cip.cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com
accessKey: "XXXXXXXXX"
secretKey: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
checkResponse: true
responseContentJsonPath: "choices.0.message.content"
responseStreamContentJsonPath: "choices.0.delta.content"
responseContentFallbackJsonPaths:
  - "output.text"
  - 'content.#(type=="text")#.text'
responseStreamContentFallbackJsonPaths:
  - "payload.delta"
  - "delta.text"
```

To enforce strict mode (no fallback), configure both fields as empty arrays:

```yaml
responseContentFallbackJsonPaths: []
responseStreamContentFallbackJsonPaths: []
```

## Observability
### Metric
ai-security-guard plugin provides following metrics:
- `ai_sec_request_deny`: count of requests denied at request phase
- `ai_sec_response_deny`: count of requests denied at response phase

#### Image response-phase metric / ai_log rename (transition window)

The image generation handlers (`lvwang/multi_modal_guard/image/openai.go` and `lvwang/multi_modal_guard/image/qwen.go`) historically emitted request-phase field names for **response-phase** events. This release corrects the semantics and keeps a **double-write transition** for 1–2 release cycles:

| Signal | Legacy value (wrong; removed in a future release) | New value (recommended) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Counter (deny) | `ai_sec_request_deny` | `ai_sec_response_deny` |
| ai_log latency (pass + deny) | `safecheck_request_rt` | `safecheck_response_rt` |
| ai_log status (deny) | `safecheck_status="reqeust deny"` (typo; **dropped immediately, no longer emitted**) | `safecheck_status="response deny"` |

During the transition window, the image response phase emits both the new and the legacy `*_deny` counters and `safecheck_*_rt` attributes; `safecheck_status` only emits the new value. Migrate dashboards / alerts to the `response_*` names; any image-response alert that still keys off the typo'd `reqeust deny` status string must move to `response deny` immediately.

### Trace
ai-security-guard plugin provides following span attributes:
- `ai_sec_risklabel`: risk type of this request
- `ai_sec_deny_phase`: denied phase of this request, value can be request/response

### AI Log
ai-security-guard writes each submission to the content security service into the AI access log, so gateway logs can be correlated with Alibaba Cloud content security requests:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `safecheck_requests` | array | Submission event array. Each item is `{"requestId"?: string, "phase": string, "modality": string, "result": string}` |
| `safecheck_request_ids` | array | All valid content security `RequestId` values for the current gateway request, preserved in submission completion order without deduplication or truncation |
| `safecheck_request_id` | string | The latest valid content security `RequestId`, kept for consumers that only read a single value |
| `safecheck_status` | string | Legacy compatibility field reflecting the last status transition for this gateway request (see enum below) |
| `safecheck_request_rt` / `safecheck_response_rt` | int | Latency (ms) of the security check during the request / response phase |
| `safecheck_riskLabel` / `safecheck_riskWords` | string | Risk label and risk words when a risk is hit (taken from the first result returned by the security service) |

`safecheck_requests[].phase` is `request` or `response`; `modality` is `text`, `image`, or `mcp`; `result` describes **the processing outcome of that submission event itself** (not the gateway's final outbound action). Values:

| `result` value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `pass` | The submission passed the check |
| `deny` | The submission hit a risk; the gateway returned a deny response |
| `mask` | The submission hit a risk with `Action=Mask`; the security service returned desensitized text and the request body was rewritten |
| `error` | The submission itself failed (HTTP non-200, business `Code` non-200, unmarshal failure, deny-response build failure, dispatch failure, etc.). When the failure occurs in the **streaming response callback** because building the deny response failed, the gateway fails open (injects buffered upstream content as-is); in that case `safecheck_status=build_fallback_pass` and the corresponding event has `result=error` to indicate the security submission did not complete |

The plugin writes `requestId`, `safecheck_request_ids`, and `safecheck_request_id` only when the security service response contains a JSON string `RequestId` and `strings.TrimSpace(RequestId) != ""`; missing, empty, whitespace-only, or non-string values do not produce empty placeholders.

Every submission attempt emits one `safecheck_requests` event, including HTTP non-200 responses, business failures, and failures to dispatch the security service call. These error paths are recorded as `result=error`. Use `safecheck_requests` for precise auditing across multiple submissions, streaming chunks, or multiple image checks.

`safecheck_status` enum (legacy field; overwritten on each status transition, so only the last transition's value is preserved when there are multiple submissions):

| `safecheck_status` value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `request pass` | All request-phase submissions passed |
| `request mask` | A request-phase submission hit mask; the request body was rewritten with desensitized text |
| `reqeust deny` | A request-phase submission hit a risk; the gateway returned a deny response (note: typo `reqeust` is preserved for backward compatibility) |
| `request error` | A request-phase security submission itself failed (HTTP / unmarshal / dispatch / etc.); the gateway fails open |
| `response pass` | All response-phase submissions passed |
| `response deny` | A response-phase submission hit a risk; the gateway returned a deny response |
| `response error` | A response-phase security submission itself failed; the gateway fails open |
| `build_fallback_pass` | In the streaming response callback, building the deny response failed; the gateway fails open and injects the buffered upstream content as-is |
