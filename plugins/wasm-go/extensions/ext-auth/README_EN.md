title: External Authentication
keywords: [higress, auth]
description: The Ext Authentication plugin implements the capability to call external authorization services for authentication and authorization.
---
## Function Description
The `ext-auth` plugin implements sending authentication requests to an external authorization service to check whether the client request is authorized. This plugin is implemented with reference to Envoy's native [ext_authz filter](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/ext_authz_filter), which covers some capabilities for connecting to HTTP services.

## Execution Properties
Plugin Execution Phase: `Authentication Phase`  
Plugin Execution Priority: `360`

### Configuration Fields for Each Item in `authorization_request`
| Name                     | Data Type               | Required | Default Value | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | -------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `allowed_headers`        | array of StringMatcher | No       | -             | When set, client request headers with matching criteria will be added to the headers of the request to the authorization service.

### Field Descriptions for `StringMatcher` Type
When using `array of StringMatcher`, the fields are configured according to the order defined in the array.
| Name       | Data Type | Required                                            | Default Value | Description |
| ---------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| `exact`    | string    | No, must select one from `exact`, `prefix`, `suffix`, `contains`, `regex` | -             | Exact match |
| `prefix`   | string    | No, must select one from `exact`, `prefix`, `suffix`, `contains`, `regex` | -             | Prefix match |
| `suffix`   | string    | No, must select one from `exact`, `prefix`, `suffix`, `contains`, `regex` | -             | Suffix match |
| `contains` | string    | No, must select one from `exact`, `prefix`, `suffix`, `contains`, `regex` | -             | Contains match |

## Configuration Example
Assuming the `ext-auth` service has a serviceName of `ext-auth`, port `8090`, path `/auth`, and namespace `backend` in Kubernetes.

Two types of `endpoint_mode` are supported:
- When `endpoint_mode` is `envoy`, the authentication request will use the original request HTTP Method, and the configured `path_prefix` will be concatenated with the original request path.
- When `endpoint_mode` is `forward_auth`, the authentication request will use the configured `request_method` as the HTTP Method and the configured `path` as the request path.

### Example 1: `endpoint_mode` is `envoy`
#### Configuration of `ext-auth` Plugin:
```yaml
http_service:
  endpoint_mode: envoy
  endpoint:
    service_name: ext-auth.backend.svc.cluster.local
    service_port: 8090
    path_prefix: /auth
  timeout: 1000
```

Using the following request to the gateway, after enabling the `ext-auth` plugin:
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 -X GET -H "foo: bar" -H "Authorization: xxx"
```

**Successful request to the `ext-auth` service:**
The `ext-auth` service will receive the following authentication request:
```
POST /auth/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 HTTP/1.1
Host: ext-auth.backend.svc.cluster.local
Authorization: xxx
Content-Length: 0
```

**Failed request to the `ext-auth` service:**
When the `ext-auth` service responds with a 5xx error, the client will receive an HTTP response code of 403 along with all response headers returned by the `ext-auth` service.

If the `ext-auth` service returns `x-auth-version: 1.0` and `x-auth-failed: true` headers, these will be conveyed to the client:
```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
x-auth-version: 1.0
x-auth-failed: true
date: Tue, 16 Jul 2024 00:19:41 GMT
server: istio-envoy
content-length: 0
```

When the `ext-auth` service is inaccessible or returns a status code of 5xx, the client request will be denied with the status code configured in `status_on_error`. When the `ext-auth` service returns other HTTP status codes, the client request will be denied with the returned status code. If `allowed_client_headers` is configured, the matching response headers will be added to the client's response.

#### Example 2: `ext-auth` Plugin Configuration:
```yaml
http_service:
  authorization_request:
    allowed_headers:
    - exact: x-auth-version
    headers_to_add:
      x-envoy-header: true
  authorization_response:
    allowed_upstream_headers:
    - exact: x-user-id
    - exact: x-auth-version
  endpoint_mode: envoy
  endpoint:
    service_name: ext-auth.backend.svc.cluster.local
    service_host: my-domain.local
    service_port: 8090
    path_prefix: /auth
  timeout: 1000
```

Using the following request to the gateway after enabling the `ext-auth` plugin:
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 -X GET -H "foo: bar" -H "Authorization: xxx"
```

The `ext-auth` service will receive the following authentication request:
```
POST /auth/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 HTTP/1.1
Host: my-domain.local
Authorization: xxx
X-Auth-Version: 1.0
x-envoy-header: true
Content-Length: 0
```

If the `ext-auth` service returns headers containing `x-user-id` and `x-auth-version`, these two request headers will be included in requests to the upstream when the gateway calls it.

### Example 1: `endpoint_mode` is `forward_auth`
`ext-auth` Plugin Configuration:
```yaml
http_service:
  endpoint_mode: forward_auth
  endpoint:
    service_name: ext-auth.backend.svc.cluster.local
    service_port: 8090
    path: /auth
    request_method: POST
  timeout: 1000
```

Using the following request to the gateway after enabling the `ext-auth` plugin:
```shell
curl -i http://localhost:8082/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 -X GET -H "foo: bar" -H "Authorization: xxx"
```

**Successful request to the `ext-auth` service:**
The `ext-auth` service will receive the following authentication request:
```
POST /auth HTTP/1.1
Host: ext-auth.backend.svc.cluster.local
Authorization: xxx
X-Original-Uri: /users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5
X-Original-Method: GET
Content-Length: 0
```

**Failed request to the `ext-auth` service:**
When the `ext-auth` service responds with a 5xx error, the client will receive an HTTP response code of 403 along with all response headers returned by the `ext-auth` service.

If the `ext-auth` service returns `x-auth-version: 1.0` and `x-auth-failed: true` headers, these will be conveyed to the client:
```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
x-auth-version: 1.0
x-auth-failed: true
date: Tue, 16 Jul 2024 00:19:41 GMT
server: istio-envoy
content-length: 0
```

When the `ext-auth` service is inaccessible or returns a status code of 5xx, the client request will be denied with the status code configured in `status_on_error`. When the `ext-auth` service returns other HTTP status codes, the client request will be denied with the returned status code. If `allowed_client_headers` is configured, the matching response headers will be added to the client's response.

#### Example 2: `ext-auth` Plugin Configuration:
```yaml
http_service:
  authorization_request:
    allowed_headers:
    - exact: x-auth-version
    headers_to_add:
      x-envoy-header: true
  authorization_response:
    allowed_upstream_headers:
    - exact: x-user-id
    - exact: x-auth-version
  endpoint_mode: forward_auth
  endpoint:
    service_name: ext-auth.backend.svc.cluster.local
    service_host: my-domain.local
    service_port: 8090
    path: /auth
    request_method: POST
  timeout: 1000
```

Using the following request to the gateway after enabling the `ext-auth` plugin:
```shell
curl -i http://localhost:8082/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 -X GET -H "foo: bar" -H "Authorization: xxx" -H "X-Auth-Version: 1.0"
```

The `ext-auth` service will receive the following authentication request:
```
POST /auth HTTP/1.1
Host: my-domain.local
Authorization: xxx
X-Original-Uri: /users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5
X-Original-Method: GET
X-Auth-Version: 1.0
x-envoy-header: true
Content-Length: 0
```

If the `ext-auth` service returns headers containing `x-user-id` and `x-auth-version`, these two request headers will be included in requests to the upstream when the gateway calls it.

#### x-forwarded-* Header
When `endpoint_mode` is `forward_auth`, Higress will automatically generate and send the following headers to the authorization service.
| Header             | Description                                   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| x-forwarded-proto  | The scheme of the original request, e.g., http/https |
| x-forwarded-method | The method of the original request, e.g., get/post/delete/patch |
| x-forwarded-host   | The host of the original request               |
| x-forwarded-uri    | The path of the original request, including path parameters, e.g., /v1/app?test=true |
| x-forwarded-for    | The client IP address of the original request   |
