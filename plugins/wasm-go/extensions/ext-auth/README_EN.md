title: External Authentication
keywords: [higress, auth]
description: The Ext Authentication plugin implements the capability to call external authorization services for authentication and authorization.
---

## Feature Description

The `ext-auth` plugin sends an authorization request to an external authorization service to check if the client request is authorized. When implementing this plugin, it refers to the native [ext_authz filter](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/ext_authz_filter) of Envoy, and realizes part of the capabilities of the native filter to connect to an HTTP service.

## Operating Attributes

Plugin Execution Phase: `Authentication Phase`
Plugin Execution Priority: `360`


## Configuration Fields

| Name | Data Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `http_service` | object | Yes | - | Configuration for the external authorization service |
| `match_type` | string | No |  | Can be `whitelist` or `blacklist` |
| `match_list` | array of MatchRule | No |  | A list containing (`match_rule_domain`, `match_rule_path`, `match_rule_type`) |
| `failure_mode_allow` | bool | No | false | When set to true, client requests will be accepted even if the communication with the authorization service fails or the authorization service returns an HTTP 5xx error |
| `failure_mode_allow_header_add` | bool | No | false | When both `failure_mode_allow` and `failure_mode_allow_header_add` are set to true, if the communication with the authorization service fails or the authorization service returns an HTTP 5xx error, the `x-envoy-auth-failure-mode-allowed: true` header will be added to the request header |
| `status_on_error` | int | No | 403 | Sets the HTTP status code returned to the client when the authorization service is inaccessible or has a 5xx status code. The default status code is `403` |

Configuration fields for each item in `http_service`

| Name | Data Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `endpoint_mode` | string | No | envoy | Can be `envoy` or `forward_auth` |
| `endpoint` | object | Yes | - | Information about the HTTP service to which the authentication request is sent |
| `timeout` | int | No | 1000 | The connection timeout for the `ext-auth` service in milliseconds |
| `authorization_request` | object | No | - | Configuration for sending the authentication request |
| `authorization_response` | object | No | - | Configuration for handling the authentication response |

Configuration fields for each item in `endpoint`

| Name | Data Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `service_name` | string | Yes | - | Enter the name of the authorization service, the full FQDN name with service type, e.g., `ext-auth.dns`, `ext-auth.my-ns.svc.cluster.local` |
| `service_port` | int | No | 80 | Enter the service port of the authorization service |
| `service_host` | string | No | - | The Host header set when requesting the authorization service. If not filled, it will be the same as the FQDN |
| `path_prefix` | string | Required when `endpoint_mode` is `envoy` | - | When `endpoint_mode` is `envoy`, the request path prefix for the client to send a request to the authorization service |
| `request_method` | string | No | GET | When `endpoint_mode` is `forward_auth`, the HTTP Method for the client to send a request to the authorization service |

Configuration fields for each item in `authorization_request`

| Name | Data Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allowed_headers` | array of StringMatcher | No | - | After setting, the client request headers that match the items will be added to the request headers in the authorization service request. In addition to the user-defined header matching rules, the `Authorization` HTTP header will be automatically included in the authorization service request (when `endpoint_mode` is `forward_auth`, the `X-Forwarded-*` request headers will be added) |
| `headers_to_add` | map[string]string | No | - | Sets the list of request headers to be included in the authorization service request. Please note that the client request headers with the same name will be overwritten |

When the client request body reaches the value set in this field, an HTTP 413 status code will be returned and the authorization process will not be started. Note that this setting takes precedence over the `failure_mode_allow` configuration |

Configuration fields for each item in `authorization_response`

| Name | Data Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allowed_upstream_headers` | array of StringMatcher | No | - | The response headers of the authentication request that match the items will be added to the original client request headers. Please note that the request headers with the same name will be overwritten |
| `allowed_client_headers` | array of StringMatcher | No | - | If not set, when the request is rejected, all the response headers of the authentication request will be added to the client's response headers. When set, when the request is rejected, the response headers of the authentication request that match the items will be added to the client's response headers |

Configuration fields for each item of `StringMatcher` type. When using `array of StringMatcher`, the StringMatchers defined in the array will be configured in order.

### Differences between the two `endpoint_mode`

When `endpoint_mode` is `envoy`, the authentication request will use the original request's HTTP Method and the configured `path_prefix` as the request path prefix, concatenated with the original request path.

When `endpoint_mode` is `forward_auth`, the authentication request will use the configured `request_method` as the HTTP Method and the configured `path` as the request path. Higress will automatically generate and send the following headers to the authorization service:

| Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `x-forwarded-proto` | The scheme of the original request, such as http/https |
| `x-forwarded-method` | The method of the original request, such as get/post/delete/patch |
| `x-forwarded-host` | The host of the original request |
| `x-forwarded-uri` | The path of the original request, including path parameters, e.g., `/v1/app?test=true` |

### Blacklist and Whitelist Modes

Supports blacklist and whitelist mode configuration. The default is the whitelist mode. If the whitelist is empty, all requests need to be verified. The matching domain supports wildcard domains such as `*.bar.com`, and the matching rule supports `exact`, `prefix`, `suffix`, `contains`, `regex`.

**Whitelist Mode**

```yaml
match_type: 'whitelist'
match_list:
    - match_rule_domain: '*.bar.com'
      match_rule_path: '/foo'
      match_rule_type: 'prefix'
```

Requests with a prefix match of `/foo` under the wildcard domain `*.bar.com` do not need to be verified.

**Blacklist Mode**

```yaml
match_type: 'blacklist'
match_list:
    - match_rule_domain: '*.bar.com'
      match_rule_path: '/headers'
      match_rule_type: 'prefix'
```

Only requests with a prefix match of `/header` under the wildcard domain `*.bar.com` need to be verified.


## Configuration Examples

Assume that in Kubernetes, the `ext-auth` service has a `serviceName` of `ext-auth`, a port of `8090`, a path of `/auth`, and is in the `backend` namespace.

### When endpoint_mode is envoy

#### Example 1

Configuration of the `ext-auth` plugin:

```yaml
http_service:
  endpoint_mode: envoy
  endpoint:
    service_name: ext-auth.backend.svc.cluster.local
    service_port: 8090
    path_prefix: /auth
  timeout: 1000
```

When using the following request to the gateway after enabling the `ext-auth` plugin:

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 -X GET -H "foo: bar" -H "Authorization: xxx"
```

**When the request to the `ext-auth` service is successful**:

The `ext-auth` service will receive the following authorization request:

```
POST /auth/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 HTTP/1.1
Host: ext-auth.backend.svc.cluster.local
Authorization: xxx
Content-Length: 0
```

**When the request to the `ext-auth` service fails**:

When the response from the `ext-auth` service is 5xx, the client will receive an HTTP response code of 403 and all the response headers returned by the `ext-auth` service.

If the `ext-auth` service returns response headers of `x-auth-version: 1.0` and `x-auth-failed: true`, they will be passed to the client.

```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
x-auth-version: 1.0
x-auth-failed: true
date: Tue, 16 Jul 2024 00:19:41 GMT
server: istio-envoy
content-length: 0
```

When the `ext-auth` service is inaccessible or the status code is 5xx, the client request will be rejected with the status code configured in `status_on_error`.

When the `ext-auth` service returns other HTTP status codes, the client request will be rejected with the returned status code. If `allowed_client_headers` is configured, the response headers with corresponding matching items will be added to the client's response.

#### Example 2

Configuration of the `ext-auth` plugin:

```yaml
http_service:
  authorization_request:
    allowed_headers:
    - exact: x-auth-version
    headers_to_add:
      x-envoy-header: true
  authorization_response:
    allowed_upstream_headers:
    - exact: x-user-id
    - exact: x-auth-version
  endpoint_mode: envoy
  endpoint:
    service_name: ext-auth.backend.svc.cluster.local
    service_host: my-domain.local
    service_port: 8090
    path_prefix: /auth
  timeout: 1000
```

When using the following request to the gateway after enabling the `ext-auth` plugin:

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 -X GET -H "foo: bar" -H "Authorization: xxx"
```

The `ext-auth` service will receive the following authorization request:

```
POST /auth/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 HTTP/1.1
Host: my-domain.local
Authorization: xxx
X-Auth-Version: 1.0
x-envoy-header: true
Content-Length: 0
```

If the response headers returned by the `ext-auth` service contain `x-user-id` and `x-auth-version`, these two headers will be included in the request when the gateway calls the upstream.

### When endpoint_mode is forward_auth

#### Example 1

Configuration of the `ext-auth` plugin:

```yaml
http_service:
  endpoint_mode: forward_auth
  endpoint:
    service_name: ext-auth.backend.svc.cluster.local
    service_port: 8090
    path: /auth
    request_method: POST
  timeout: 1000
```

When using the following request to the gateway after enabling the `ext-auth` plugin:

```shell
curl -i http://localhost:8082/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 -X GET -H "foo: bar" -H "Authorization: xxx" -H "Host: foo.bar.com"
```

**When the request to the `ext-auth` service is successful**:

The `ext-auth` service will receive the following authorization request:

```
POST /auth HTTP/1.1
Host: ext-auth.backend.svc.cluster.local
Authorization: xxx
X-Forwarded-Proto: HTTP
X-Forwarded-Host: foo.bar.com
X-Forwarded-Uri: /users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5
X-Forwarded-Method: GET
Content-Length: 0
```

**When the request to the `ext-auth` service fails**:

When the response from the `ext-auth` service is 5xx, the client will receive an HTTP response code of 403 and all the response headers returned by the `ext-auth` service.

If the `ext-auth` service returns response headers of `x-auth-version: 1.0` and `x-auth-failed: true`, they will be passed to the client.

```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
x-auth-version: 1.0
x-auth-failed: true
date: Tue, 16 Jul 2024 00:19:41 GMT
server: istio-envoy
content-length: 0
```

When the `ext-auth` service is inaccessible or the status code is 5xx, the client request will be rejected with the status code configured in `status_on_error`.

When the `ext-auth` service returns other HTTP status codes, the client request will be rejected with the returned status code. If `allowed_client_headers` is configured, the response headers with corresponding matching items will be added to the client's response.

#### Example 2

Configuration of the `ext-auth` plugin:

```yaml
http_service:
  authorization_request:
    allowed_headers:
    - exact: x-auth-version
    headers_to_add:
      x-envoy-header: true
  authorization_response:
    allowed_upstream_headers:
    - exact: x-user-id
    - exact: x-auth-version
  endpoint_mode: forward_auth
  endpoint:
    service_name: ext-auth.backend.svc.cluster.local
    service_host: my-domain.local
    service_port: 8090
    path: /auth
    request_method: POST
  timeout: 1000
```

When using the following request to the gateway after enabling the `ext-auth` plugin:

```shell
curl -i http://localhost:8082/users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5 -X GET -H "foo: bar" -H "Authorization: xxx" -H "X-Auth-Version: 1.0" -H "Host: foo.bar.com"
```

The `ext-auth` service will receive the following authorization request:

```
POST /auth HTTP/1.1
Host: my-domain.local
Authorization: xxx
X-Forwarded-Proto: HTTP
X-Forwarded-Host: foo.bar.com
X-Forwarded-Uri: /users?apikey=9a342114-ba8a-11ec-b1bf-00163e1250b5
X-Forwarded-Method: GET
X-Auth-Version: 1.0
x-envoy-header: true
Content-Length: 0
```

If the response headers returned by the `ext-auth` service contain `x-user-id` and `x-auth-version`, these two headers will be included in the request when the gateway calls the upstream.
