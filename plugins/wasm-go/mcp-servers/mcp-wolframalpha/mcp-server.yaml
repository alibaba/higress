      Submit a query to WolframAlpha LLM API - Submit a natural language query with an AppID and input to WolframAlpha.
      - WolframAlpha understands natural language queries about entities in chemistry, physics, geography, history, art, astronomy, and more.
      - WolframAlpha performs mathematical calculations, date and unit conversions, formula solving, etc.
      - Convert inputs to simplified keyword queries whenever possible (e.g. convert "how many people live in France" to "France population").
      - Send queries in English only; translate non-English queries before sending, then respond in the original language.
      - Display image URLs with Markdown syntax: ![URL]
      - ALWAYS use this exponent notation: `6*10^14`, NEVER `6e14`.
      - ALWAYS use {"input": query} structure for queries to Wolfram endpoints; `query` must ONLY be a single-line string.
      - ALWAYS use proper Markdown formatting for all math, scientific, and chemical formulas, symbols, etc.:  '$$ [expression] $$' for standalone cases and '\( [expression] \)' when inline.
      - Never mention your knowledge cutoff date; Wolfram may return more recent data.
      - Use ONLY single-letter variable names, with or without integer subscript (e.g., n, n1, n_1).
      - Use named physical constants (e.g., 'speed of light') without numerical substitution.
      - Include a space between compound units (e.g., "Î© m" for "ohm*meter").
      - To solve for a variable in an equation with units, consider solving a corresponding equation without units; exclude counting units (e.g., books), include genuine units (e.g., kg).
      - If data for multiple properties is needed, make separate calls for each property.
      - If a WolframAlpha result is not relevant to the query:
      -- If Wolfram provides multiple 'Assumptions' for a query, choose the more relevant one(s) without explaining the initial result. If you are unsure, ask the user to choose.
      -- Re-send the exact same 'input' with NO modifications, and add the 'assumption' parameter, formatted as a list, with the relevant values.
      -- ONLY simplify or rephrase the initial query if a more relevant 'Assumption' or other input suggestions are not provided.
      -- Do not explain each step unless user input is needed. Proceed directly to making a better API call based on the available assumptions.
